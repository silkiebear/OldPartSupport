# OldPartSupport

## Overview

OldPartSupport enables loading older craft files that use deprecated parts by providing instructions for manually copying them from the zDeprecated folder back to their original locations.

This mod specifically supports:
- RCS Block RV-105 (the older version that was moved to zDeprecated)
- Service Bay 1.25m and 2.5m (the older versions that were moved to zDeprecated)

## Installation (Manual File Copying Required)

**IMPORTANT: This mod requires manual file copying!**

1. Extract the zip file into your KSP GameData folder
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in INSTRUCTIONS.txt to copy the files

## How It Works

1. Manually copy the deprecated parts from the Squad/zDeprecated folders to their original locations
2. This allows craft files to find the parts without showing them in the VAB/SPH
