OldPartSupport - Manual Installation Instructions
=======================================

To enable loading of craft files with deprecated parts, you need to manually copy
these parts from their zDeprecated location to their original locations.

STEP 1: Create these directories (if they don't already exist)
--------------------------------------------------------------
* GameData/Squad/Parts/Utility/rcsBlockRV-105
* GameData/Squad/Parts/Utility/ServiceBay

STEP 2: Copy the following files
--------------------------------------------------------------
* Copy all files from: GameData/Squad/zDeprecated/Parts/Utility/rcsBlockRV-105_v1/
  To: GameData/Squad/Parts/Utility/rcsBlockRV-105/

* Copy all files from: GameData/Squad/zDeprecated/Parts/Utility/ServiceBay_v1/
  To: GameData/Squad/Parts/Utility/ServiceBay/

STEP 3: Start KSP
--------------------------------------------------------------
Your old craft files should now load properly without missing part errors.
The HideParts.cfg file will ensure these parts don't appear in the catalog.

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------
If your craft files still don't load:
1. Make sure you copied ALL files (including .cfg, .mu, and .dds files)
2. Verify the file paths exactly match what's described above
3. Try restarting KSP after copying the files
